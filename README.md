# Discrete Fourier Transform Tool (DFTT)


## Motivation
I always wondered how the DFT and its FFT algorithms are implemented in code. So I decided to create a project that tries to implement various different algorithms to shed light on how certain FFT implementations can be coded in C. The main point is that the code is commented and as easy to understand as possible, while using the standard libraries for compatibility. Therefore, speed and memory efficiency are not a priority in this project.
